Personal University projects

Since September 2022, i have created 3 more complex projects during my studies.

My first project was an iOS application in UIkit and SwiftUI, that helps people to track their daily fluid intake.
It functions as a notebook, plus you can create unique notifictions, that reminds you to drink
enough liquid during the day. What's more, you can choose between 3 languages and 2 units of measurement. 
In addition, it provides unique settings, for example: set your daily goal or create your own
shortcut buttons. Finally, it has a widget option, which is quite helpful.

My second project was about how to create object oriented program in C++. It represents a simple online shoe outlet.
It can be tested with built in tests and through the terminal.

Last, but not least, i have created an appliction in Java with GUI. I have decided to create an appliction about the Turmite, 
which is "a Turing machine which has an orientation in addition to a current state and a "tape" 
that consists of an infinite two-dimensional grid of cells" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmite. 
During this project, i have learned a lot about how to create GUI in Java with threading.
